This project "encrypts" data by locking it under a secure key. However, unlike SHA and other normal encryption methods, the entire decryption algorithm consists of a single multiplication by a constant! Technically, a string is converted into an (odd) integer and then multiplied by a constant, but the bulk of the math consists of a single multiplication. It may be that there is an obvious way to break the encoding, but I haven't found one yet (though admittedly I made this very recently and haven't been looking for very long). The entire decryption program is less than 40 lines long.
