This project "encrypts" data by locking it under a secure key. However, unlike SHA and other normal encryption methods, the entire decryption algorithm consists of a single multiplication by a constant! It may be that there is an obvious way to break the encoding, but I haven't found one yet (though admittedly I haven't spent a lot of time trying to break it). The entire decryption program is less than 40 lines long. It doesn't have many uses as far as I can tell (maybe as part of an ARG?). However, it's simplicity made it interesting to me, and so I decided to make it.
